    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz. rice linguini noodles</li>
        <li>8 oz. raw shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1/4 c. plus 1 tbsp. sweet chili sauce, divided</li>
        <li>8 oz. snow peas, sliced on the diagonal</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Canola oil, divided </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 3-4 quarts of water to a boil and remove from heat. Place rice linguine noodles in a large metal or glass bowl and cover in hot water for 25 minutes, stirring with a fork frequently to break up any noodle clumps. After about 15 minutes water should be cool enough to pull out and separate any clumped noodles.</li>
        <li>Rinse shrimp and place on a paper towel lined plate. Pat dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add shrimp and 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce to a container with a lid. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes and up to overnight. </li>
        <li>Drain and rinse noodles and return to the bowl. Gather your ingredients (noodles, shrimp, remaining 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, and snow peas) in bowls and place on a sheet tray next to the stove. </li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl in pan to coat. When you see the first wisp of smoke, add shrimp and cook until they begin to turn pink, 1 minute each side. The sugars in the sweet chili sauce should caramelize just a little bit and create tasty bits in the pan. </li>
        <li>Make space in the middle of the pan, add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sliced snow peas and cook 2 minutes. Add prepared noodles and Â¼ cup of sweet chili sauce. Continue to cook until noodles are coated and heated through, about 4 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
